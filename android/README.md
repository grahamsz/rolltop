# Rolltop Android

This is a native Android wrapper for a Rolltop server. It gives Rolltop an installable Android app surface with WebView session persistence, notification polling, Android contacts/file pickers, default mail app registration intents, Android share targets, and a server-driven update prompt flow.

## Build

```sh
./android/gradlew -p android :app:assembleDebug
```

CI uploads a release APK when signing secrets are configured; unsigned environments upload a debug APK for testing only.

## First Run

Enter the HTTPS URL for the Rolltop server, then sign in through the embedded WebView. Shared preferences hold the normalized server URL plus local route, notification-cursor, and update state. Credentials are not copied there; Rolltop session cookies remain in Android WebView cookie storage.

## Default Mail App

The app declares `mailto:` handlers and uses `RoleManager.ROLE_EMAIL` on Android 10 and newer to request the default mail app role. Older Android versions fall back to the system default-apps settings screen.

Rolltop still does not send SMTP mail from the Android shell. Compose actions are routed to the Rolltop `/compose` page.

## Share Targets

Android `ACTION_SEND`, `ACTION_SEND_MULTIPLE`, `ACTION_SENDTO`, and `mailto:` links open Rolltop compose with the available subject/body fields prefilled. Shared photos and files are streamed from their Android content URIs into the existing compose attachment pipeline, so they appear as real removable attachments and use the normal multipart send/draft APIs. Multiple streams and `ClipData` are supported.

The stream bridge is exposed only to the configured Rolltop HTTPS origin. It uses random, short-lived URLs intercepted for both page and service-worker requests inside the WebView; shared bodies are not logged or saved as separate attachment blobs by the Android shell.

The ordinary compose attachment and inline-photo buttons use Android's system file chooser as well.

## Android Contacts

Recipient fields always show a contact-picker button in the Android app. It opens the system email contact picker and returns only the address the user selected, without requiring broad contacts access.

Typed recipient suggestions initially come from Rolltop's server-side contacts. The compose suggestion panel also offers an explicit **Enable Android contacts** action. Only that user action requests Android's runtime `READ_CONTACTS` permission. Once granted, each typed query uses Android's email contact filter locally, caps the result set, and merges it with Rolltop suggestions by email address. Device contacts are not imported, persisted, or uploaded to the server. If access is denied, server suggestions and the single-address system picker continue to work.

## Notifications

The app schedules a persistent, network-constrained 15-minute WorkManager poll against `/api/notifications/new-mail`. The server records only current incremental INBOX arrivals, and the app persists a durable event cursor bound to the configured server and authenticated user. Its first poll, an account switch, or a restored server cursor establishes a silent baseline, so existing unread mail is never replayed as thousands of new messages.

A single arrival shows its sender and subject and opens that message. Multiple arrivals use an expanded inbox-style notification and open All Mail. Before a user opens the destination, the app makes a bounded best-effort warm-up request: message bodies use the side-effect-free `/api/messages/:id/prefetch` route, while multiple-message alerts warm the first All Mail page. Prefetching never marks a message read or queues an IMAP `\Seen` update.

Android 13 and newer require the runtime notification permission.

Polling relies on the WebView login cookie for the configured Rolltop server. If the session expires, the app stops notifying until the user signs in again.

## Updates

The updater checks:

```text
<server-url>/android/latest.json
```

Expected metadata:

```json
{
  "versionCode": 2,
  "versionName": "0.2.0",
  "apkUrl": "https://mail.example.com/android/rolltop.apk",
  "sha256": "optional lowercase hex sha256"
}
```

The app checks lightweight metadata whenever it enters the foreground and also uses persistent, network-constrained WorkManager scheduling. When `versionCode` is newer than the installed app, the APK is downloaded, optionally verified with `sha256`, and offered through an in-app dialog and update notification. A validated download is reused for the same version and remains available across app restarts, including when notification permission is denied.

Android does not allow a normal sideloaded app to silently replace itself. Users must confirm the install prompt, and may need to allow Rolltop to install unknown apps.

Update APKs must always use the Rolltop application ID, the offered version code, and a signing certificate compatible with the installed app. The client verifies all three before showing an install action. CI publishes `/android/latest.json` and `/android/rolltop.apk` into the server image only when all five repository secrets are configured:

```text
ROLLTOP_ANDROID_KEYSTORE_BASE64
ROLLTOP_ANDROID_STORE_PASSWORD
ROLLTOP_ANDROID_KEY_ALIAS
ROLLTOP_ANDROID_KEY_PASSWORD
ROLLTOP_ANDROID_CERT_SHA256
```

`ROLLTOP_ANDROID_KEYSTORE_BASE64` is the base64 encoding of the release keystore. `ROLLTOP_ANDROID_CERT_SHA256` is the release certificate's SHA-256 digest as printed by `keytool -list -v` for the keystore alias, or by `apksigner verify --print-certs` for a locally signed APK; CI pins it to prevent an accidental keystore change. Keep the original keystore backed up outside GitHub; losing it prevents updates to existing installs. Pull requests and untagged builds without these secrets still produce a debug APK artifact, but it is deliberately not published as a server update. Tagged builds fail when release signing is unavailable or only partially configured.

CI assigns a monotonic version code from `GITHUB_RUN_NUMBER`, verifies the APK signature, and reads the resulting APK metadata when writing `latest.json`, so the feed and APK cannot disagree. Android unit tests exercise the newer-version offer, same-origin APK, and checksum policies. Local builds default to version code 2; `ROLLTOP_ANDROID_VERSION_CODE` and `ROLLTOP_ANDROID_VERSION_NAME` can override it.

## Testing Server Updates

1. Configure the five signing secrets and deploy a CI-built server image.
2. Install its release APK. An app previously installed from the legacy debug build must be uninstalled once because Android cannot replace an APK signed by a different certificate.
3. Run and deploy a later CI build. Its version code will be higher.
4. Fully close and reopen Rolltop. It should download the same-origin APK and offer **Install**. Accept the one-time "install unknown apps" permission if Android requests it, then return to the update prompt or notification.

After that signing transition, later server APKs install in place and preserve WebView sessions and preferences.
